    "prompt": "What are some examples of isocyanate-reactive compounds used in the production of tin-free polyurethane foam?",
    "expected_completion": "Isocyanate-reactive compounds used in the production of tin-free polyurethane foam include polyisocyanates and compounds containing isocyanate-reactive hydrogen atoms.",
    "base_completion": "The term \"isocyanates\" refers to a class of organic molecules that contains two nitrogen atoms bonded together. They're commonly found in plastics, adhesives and sealants, but they can also be made into industrial chemicals. Some common examples include acrylate polymers (aka acrylic acid), glycidyl ethers (acid esters) like MDI or diethylenetriamine penta",

    "prompt": "What is the composition of the acrylic copolymer used in the multilayer composite and underlayment for roof assembly?",
    "expected_completion": "The composition of the acrylic copolymer includes monomer A, monomer B, and monomer C, which are polymerized in an amount from 90-99.5 wt.%, along with a crosslinker in an amount of 0.5-10 wt.%.",

    "prompt": "What is the density range of the flame-protected polyurethane foam?",
    "expected_completion": "The flame-protected polyurethane foam has a density range of 5 to 50 g/L.",
    "base_completion": "A: The density of flameproof polyurea will vary depending on factors such as product grade, manufacturing process and weather. In general, the higher a grade number or an OEK 8170 certified material, the more resistant it is to fire, but there may be some variation in its thickness due to this factor. It's always best to check the documentation supplied with your purchased item for specific details about how dense it is before specifying its use",
    "finetuned_completion": "The flameprotective polyurethanefoam has a density ranging from 20 to 145 kg/m3."

    "prompt": "What is the purpose of subjecting the material to a free radical source in the method of making the environmentally durable material?",
    "expected_completion": "The purpose of subjecting the material to a free radical source is to eliminate substantially all functional groups Fc in the material without polymerizing it.",
    "base_completion": "A. To remove any adsorbed organic matter and to reduce moisture content for fabrication of the materials at low temperature. B. To provide a more durable surface with which to write on, as well as help maintain that finish. C. For prevention of oxidative degradation at elevated temperatures during storage or long term use. D. For protection from ultraviolet light. E. As a preservative against fungus growth.",
    "finetuned_completion": "The purpose of exposing the substrate to a radiation-curable or thermosetting reactive compound (A) in an amount greater than 2% by weight, based on the total mass of components (A), is to facilitate curing."

    "prompt": "What is the role of sebacic acid in the catalyst used in the production of polyurethane boots?",
    "expected_completion": "Sebacic acid is one of the components of the catalyst used in the production of polyurethane boots. It helps enhance the catalytic properties of the tertiary amine.",
    "base_completion": "What are some examples of compounds that contain carbon and oxygen called carboxylic acids or esters (e.g., phenol, glycolic acid)?\nDuring what stages does a 10-day experiment turn into an investigation?\nWhy was it important for William Tell to have his own gun so he could defend himself against the Swiss guards? What weapon did William tell them would be more appropriate than a crossbow?\nHow did William'",
    "finetuned_completion": "Sebacic acids are included as a component in the alkoxysilanes, which act as both monomer and polymer additives in the process."
